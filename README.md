# HelloWorld

--This is a HelloWorldDemo that has a WebAPI that inherits from a baseWebApi with functions that will be written at a later date that will write to a Database or LogFiles, Etc.  

--The solution contains a Console appliation to call the API and desplay the results of the Get WebMethod.

--And finally it contains a unit test project with a test to test the WebAPI Get method.

When the soltuion is ran in Debug mode it starts both the webApi Project and the Console Application. You will be able to step through the calls and see the result printed in the Console application.
The WebApi is stand alone and can be easilly called from a WebApp, Desktop App, Windows Service, or other application in the future.
